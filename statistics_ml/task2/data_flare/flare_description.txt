Attribute Information:
   1. Code for class (modified Zurich class)  (A,B,C,D,E,F,H)
   2. Code for largest spot size              (X,R,S,A,H,K)
   3. Code for spot distribution              (X,O,I,C)
   4. Activity                                (1 = reduced, 2 = unchanged)
   5. Evolution                               (1 = decay, 2 = no growth, 
                                               3 = growth)
   6. Previous 24 hour flare activity code    (1 = nothing as big as an M1,
                                               2 = one M1,
                                               3 = more activity than one M1)
   7. Historically-complex                    (1 = Yes, 2 = No)
   8. Did region become historically complex  (1 = yes, 2 = no) 
      on this pass across the sun's disk
   9. Area                                    (1 = small, 2 = large)
  10. Area of the largest spot                (1 = <=5, 2 = >5)

From all these predictors three classes of flares are predicted, which are  represented in the last three columns.

  11. C-class flares production by this region    Number  
      in the following 24 hours (common flares)
  12. M-class flares production by this region    Number
      in the following 24 hours (moderate flares)
  13. X-class flares production by this region    Number
      in the following 24 hours (severe flares)
